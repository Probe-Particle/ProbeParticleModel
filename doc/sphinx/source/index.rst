Welcome to ppafm's documentation!
================================================

This is the Python API documentation for ppafm, a simulation package for functionalized-tip high-resolution atomic force microscopy.
You can find the source code on `Github <https://github.com/Probe-Particle/ppafm>`_.
For installation instructions and an explanation of the simulation model and the command-line interface, see the `wiki <https://github.com/Probe-Particle/ppafm/wiki>`_.

The API documentation is a work-in-progress and many things are still missing.
At the moment, probably the most useful pages to look at are those for the GPU-accelerated simulation API,
especially the :class:`.AFMulator` class and the machine learning tools at :mod:`ppafm.ml`.
