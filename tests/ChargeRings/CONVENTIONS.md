### Way of minimal interference

 - Try to solve the problem with minimal changes to existing code
 - Do not edit code which is not esential to solving the problem
 - Try not to change code which can break something else
 - Try to reuse existing functions before you start implementing your own (if it does not break existing usage of those functions)

### Formating

 - prefer comments at the end of code line rather than above
 - do not break lines, line lenght can be infinite
 - write concise comment
