Welcome to ppafm's documentation!
================================================

This is the Python API documentation for ppafm. It's a work-in-progress and many things are still missing. You can access the source code at `Github <https://github.com/Probe-Particle/ppafm>`_. For an explanation of the simulation model and examples of usage, see the `wiki <https://github.com/Probe-Particle/ppafm/wiki>`_.
